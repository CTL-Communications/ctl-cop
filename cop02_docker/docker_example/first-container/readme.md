# Welcome to your first Docker practice round!

CTL is in need of a new and flashy web app with their logo in it.
They would like to deploy this to a server somewhere so that others can view and admire the design.

Developers at CTL have been hard at work and have assembled a Nodejs web app,
particularly an Express app with handlebars view engine.

It is your job to take their great code and deploy it to a server where other users can see it.

- Short Disclaimer

We have ZERO budget for this, so the company doesn't mind if the server is up only for a short while, it's just a demo in the end :)

## Download the code

If you have `git` installed in your computer. Clone the repository to your local machine. 

`git clone https://github.com/CTL-Communications/ctl-cop`

If you already cloned this repository in the past, grab the latest updates.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
```

## Create a DockerHub account

We are going to use a Docker lab to tinker with docker. This is provided by the Play with Docker service and it will also hold our server for free!
