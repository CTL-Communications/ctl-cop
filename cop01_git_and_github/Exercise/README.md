NASA has built and app to calculate how long it would take a spacecraft to travel to Mars.
Unfortunately, it is currently lacking some engineers and physicist to make those calculations.
Your team's job is to fill in the gaps with your genious calculations.

Decide amongst your team who will be the following roles:

* Physicist
* Mathematitian
* Aerospace engineer

Then follow these steps:

1. Configure your local git to setup your username and email address.
2. Clone this repository
3. Edit the `data.js` file under the `app` folder and add the following information depending on your role:
   1. If you are the Physicist, you discovered that the spacecraft should travel across 300 million miles to reach Mars. (replace 0 with your value in *miles*)
   2. If you are the Aerospace engineer, you concluded that the spacecraft should travel at 24600 miles per hour. (replace 0 with your value in *speed*)
   3. If you are the Mathematitian, you are to calculate how many hours there are in a normal 365 day year. (replace 0 with your value in *hours*)
4. Push your changes and ask one of your team members to review your scientific conclusions.
5. Once all the calculations are input, load the index.html file in your computer to see how many months will the spacecraft take to reach Mars!

Lookout for conflicting files! Are you an organised team? Good luck :)
